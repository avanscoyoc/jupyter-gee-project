              conservation concern for this subspecies is increasing markedly.
              We conducted a five-year multi-season dietary study in the Mojave
              Desert near the city of Barstow, California, USA, in which we
              collected and analyzed over 1,200 Desert Kit Fox scats. Desert Kit
              Foxes specialized on heteromyid rodents, even when this preferred
              prey declined during a drought. Invertebrates were also regularly
              consumed and use of this prey type increased when rodents
              decreased. Opportunistic items such as birds, reptiles, and
              Pistachio (Pistacia vera) nuts supplemented the Desert Kit Fox
              diet. We conclude that Desert Kit Foxes in California are rodent
              and invertebrate specialists, but they have sufficient ecological
              plasticity to expand their diet in response to environmental
              changes, similar to other canids. Management strategies should
              thus include steps to maintain healthy prey populations as well as
              a variety of available food options in the event of declines in
              primary foods. Ecological plasticity may allow Desert Kit Foxes to
              adapt and persist despite anthropogenic landscape modifications

               during 1950–2013 are estimated using remote sensing and GIS
               techniques. Firstly, the FAO Penman-Monteith method was used to
               model the spatial distribution of ETo on a grid-by-grid basis
               using data collected from meteorological stations and GIS
               techniques. Then, crop coefficients (Kc) were modeled as a
               function of 16-day time-series MODIS normalized difference
               vegetation index (NDVI). Next, using Kc maps and ETo as input,
               daily AET was simulated by the soil water balance (SWB) model and
               aggregated to monthly and annual AET. From empirical NDVI-Kc
               relationships developed and applicable at pixel level, Kc derived
               from the NDVI-Kc relationships agree well with Kc recommended by
               FAO over various crop growth stages in the field. The monthly AET
               maps for 1950–2013 show a gradual increase in AET during the
               crop-growing season in January to May but a subsequent decline as
               the season progresses from June to December. The AET estimated
               for January to June are arranged in descending order, which are
               May (3.67–44.7 mm/day), April (5.99–36.8 mm/day), March
               (2.96–32.7 mm/day), February (0.68–20 mm/day), June (2.42–17.7
               mm/day) and January (1–11 mm/day), respectively. Statistical
               analysis shows that statistically significant change point in
               daily AET generally occurred in 1990, such that the long-term
               average daily AET of 1950–1990 at 3.6 mm/day increased to about
               5.3 mm/day between 1990 and 2016 with a positive trend of 1.5
               mm/decade. The annual AET estimated for irrigated cropland in
               northern and central regions of Riyadh, Al-Qassim province and
               Hail province range from 1200 to 2900 mm/year. In these regions,
               low AET values are found in shrubland, grassland, and other
               natural vegetation. The annual AET estimated by the SWB model are
               about 9–11\% higher than modeled AET in the study area, where the
               long-term average daily AET estimated for 1950–2013 range from 2
               mm/day to 30 mm/day. Representative AET maps derived from

               most radical cultural and environmental changes in its history.
               The 668,500-hectare Greater Mara is of crucial importance for the

               culture. However, the magnitude and pace of these fencing
               processes in this area are almost completely unknown. We provide
               new evidence that fencing is appropriating land in this area at
               an unprecedented and accelerating speed and scale. By means of a
               mapped series of multispectral satellite imagery (1985-2016), we
               found that in the conservancies with the most fences, areal cover
               of fenced areas has increased with >20\% since 2010. This has
               resulted in a situation where fencing is rapidly increasing
               across the Greater Mara, threatening to lead to the collapse of

               was an open landscape. The fencing poses challenges to both
               wildlife and the traditional pastoralism practised by Maasai
               communities, which were dependent on the presence of open
               communal land. The purpose of the article is to identify the root
               causes of the enclosure of former common land and the increasing
               fencing of plots of land owned by individual Maasai. The study is
               based on empirical material from extended fieldwork conducted in
               two villages adjacent to the reserve and a review of relevant
               documents. The main finding is that the history of land division,
               the introduction of wildlife conservancies, and the
               materialization of an ageold discourse about the ‘end of

               effectiveness is difficult. Our review of 49 tropical protected

               quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years
               at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water
               was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took
               in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015
               permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost
               90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake
               Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering
               184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental
               regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania,
               which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the
               increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change is
               also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than
               gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss
               occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought
               and human actions including river diversion or damming and
               unregulated withdrawal. Losses in Australia and the USA linked to
               long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent,

               and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is
               altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely

               ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated
               by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of
               these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to
               ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various
               taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate,
               and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers;
               altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream
               morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence
               with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will
               ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and
               all that depends upon them, including humans.",

               Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract
               spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat
               time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes
               in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events
               and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the
               recognition that change is not simply a contrast between
               conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process
               operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept
               requires both new algorithms to extract change and new
               interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge
               is to resolve salient features of the time series while
               eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in
               illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric
               registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative
               radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to
               create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and
               extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a
               pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation
               strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting
               of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of
               both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt
               events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory
               pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and
               threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive
               detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess
               the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm
               performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion
               interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework
               of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and
               developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert
               interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories
               (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010).
               These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the
               behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral
               indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred
               points across western Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.). Because of
               the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we
               evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for
               disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events
               and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of
               parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters
               along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events
               with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm
               performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and
               recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that
               contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler
               thresholds of change than available from prior validation

               cover change continuously as new images are collected and
               providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud,
               cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating
               “noisy” observations. A time series model that has components of
               seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and
               brightness temperature. The time series model is updated
               dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the
               differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover
               change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all
               seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and
               predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a
               pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover
               classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from
               the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
               model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest
               Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat
               scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a
               total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were
               used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing
               the change detection accuracy, with 250pixels selected within
               areas of persistent land cover and 250pixels selected within
               areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy
               assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting
               land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98\% and user's
               accuracies of 86\% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of

               40 quadrates were investigated in each site. Plant coverage,
               above-ground biomass, species richness and life-form were
               recorded; species diversity was calculated using the Simpson
               index and soil parameters were also measured. Our results
               indicate that the proportion of silt decreases from 12\% in the
               slight stage to 1\% in the very severe stage, clay from 71\% to
               42\% and sand from 17\% to 93\%. Soil water-holding capacity
               clearly decreases from the slight to the very severe stage. Soil
               organic matter (OM) is also reduced with desert development,

               species, especially grasses, were lost from the community

               regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of
               environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and
               large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed.
               We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in
               fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management
               strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and
               anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50
               years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season
               and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in
               fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the
               drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression
               policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado
               biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire
               is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation
               conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the
               remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude
               fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire
               management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire
               risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of
               ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated
               Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident.
               However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in

               growth-form cover, as well as the effects of shrub and grass

               composition and cover were sampled on seven occasions between the
               years 2000 and 2020, in permanent line-transects. We compared
               plant cover, richness, diversity and growth-form cover between
               the periods for each area. Next, we developed mixed-effect linear
               models to test whether species richness in grasslands at the
               latest sampling event was altered by species representing 70\% of
               the species cover at this time. Results Grasslands located in
               areas under higher anthropogenic pressure presented reduced
               richness and diversity, and cover concentrated on a few species
               of shrubs and large tussock grasses. Moist grassland undergoing
               encroachment by the native shrub Trembleya parviflora had lost
               over 50\% of its diversity since encroachment. In the same area,
               a shrub grassland undergoing encroachment by native shrub
               Raulinoreitzia tremula, three native grass species and one exotic

               some also emphasize the conservation of remaining large tracts of

               processes gaining a foothold in areas of contiguous intact
               habitat. Here, we test the strength of spatial contagion in the
               pattern of habitat clearance. Using a global dataset of
               land-cover change at 50 x 50 km resolution, we discover that
               intact habitat areas in grid cells are refractory to clearance

               (CH4) from grazing livestock, and emit nitrous oxide (N2O) from
               soils. Little is known about how the fluxes of these three
               greenhouse gases, from managed and natural grasslands worldwide,
               have contributed to past climate change, or the roles of managed
               pastures versus natural grasslands. Here, global trends and
               regional patterns of the full greenhouse gas balance of
               grasslands are estimated for the period 1750 to 2012. A new
               spatially explicit land surface model is applied, to separate the
               direct effects of human activities from land management and the
               indirect effects from climate change, increasing CO2 and regional
               changes in nitrogen deposition. Direct human management
               activities are simulated to have caused grasslands to switch from
               a sink to a source of greenhouse gas, because of increased
               livestock numbers and accelerated conversion of natural lands to
               pasture. However, climate change drivers contributed a net carbon
               sink in soil organic matter, mainly from the increased
               productivity of grasslands due to increased CO2 and nitrogen
               deposition. The net radiative forcing of all grasslands is
               currently close to neutral, but has been increasing since the
               1960s. Here, we show that the net global climate warming caused
               by managed grassland cancels the net climate cooling from carbon
               sinks in sparsely grazed and natural grasslands. In the face of
               future climate change and increased demand for livestock
               products, these findings highlight the need to use sustainable
               management to preserve and enhance soil carbon storage in
               grasslands and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from managed
               grasslands.",

               terrestrial vertebrates. We found that 9.3\% of the world is
               covered by protected connected lands (average for all the world's
               ecoregions) for a reference dispersal distance of 10 km,
               increasing up to 11.7\% for the largest dispersal distance
               considered of 100 km. These percentages are considerably smaller
               than the global PA coverage of 14.7\%, indicating that the
               spatial arrangement of PAs is only partially successful in
               ensuring connectivity of protected lands. The connectivity of PAs
               largely differed across ecoregions. Only about a third of the

               of the terrestrial realm covered by well-connected systems of

              Another approach is to use foliar-water indices based on the
              absorption at shortwave-infrared wavelengths by liquid water in
              the leaves to determine canopy water content, which is then
              related to VWC. An example of these indices is the normalized

              related to canopy water content using various datasets, including
              data from the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 and 2005 in central
              Iowa. Here we compared independent estimates of VWC from WindSat
              to Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDII over

  abstract = "The OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has recently been proposed
              for estimation of soil moisture using only optical remote sensing
              data. The model relies on a physical linear relationship between
              the soil moisture content and shortwave infrared transformed
              reflectance (STR) and can be parameterized universally (i.e., a
              single calibration for a given area) based on the pixel
              distribution within the STR-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
              (NDVI) trapezoidal space. The main motivation for this study was
              to evaluate how the universal parameterization of OPTRAM works for
              long periods of time (e.g., several decades). This is especially
              relevant for uncovering the soil moisture and agricultural drought
              history in response to climate change in different regions. In
              this study, MODIS satellite observations from 2001 to 2017 were
              acquired and used for the analysis. Cosmic-ray neutron (CRN) soil
              moisture data, collected with the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture
              Observing System (COSMOS) at five different sites in the U.S.
              covering diverse climates, soil types, and land covers, were
              applied for evaluation of the MODIS-OPTRAM-based soil moisture
              estimates. The OPTRAM soil moisture estimates were further
              compared to the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) (L-band),
              the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) (L-band), and the Advanced
              AScatterometer (ASCAT) (C-band) soil moisture retrievals. OPTRAM
              soil moisture data were also analyzed for potential monitoring of
              agricultural drought through comparison of the OPTRAM-based Soil
              Water Deficit Index (OPTRAM-SWDI) with the widely-applied Crop
              Moisture Index (CMI). Evaluation results indicate that
              OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates provide overall unbiased RMSE
              and R between 0.050 and 0.085 cm3 cm−3 and 0.10 to 0.70,
              respectively, for all investigated sites. The performance of
              OPTRAM is comparable with the ASCAT retrievals, but slightly less
              accurate than SMAP and SMOS. OPTRAM and the three microvave
              satellites captured CRN soil moisture temporal dynamics very well
              for all five investigated sites. A close agreement was observed
              between the OPTRAM-SWDI and CMI drought indices for most selected
              sites. In conclusion, OPTRAM can estimate temporal soil moisture
              dynamics with reasonable accuracy for a range of climatic
              conditions (semi-arid to humid), soil types, and land covers, and
              can potentially be applied for agricultural drought monitoring.",

              Thus, the modeling is carried out as a linear combination of a

              models have proved to be appropriate for the purpose of large

               on productive lands, conservation policies, or the spatial
               decoupling of agricultural production from consumption.
               Abandonment has major environmental and social impacts, which
               differ starkly depending on the geographical context, as does its
               potential to serve as a land reservoir for recultivation.
               Understanding determinants of abandonment patterns, and
               especially how their influence varies across broad geographic
               extents, is therefore important. Using a pan-European map of
               agricultural abandonment derived from MODIS NDVI time series
               between 2001 and 2012, we quantified the importance of farm
               management, climatic, environmental, and socio-economic variables
               in explaining abandonment patterns. We chose a machine learning
               modelling framework that accounts for spatial variation in the
               relationship between abandonment and its determinants. We
               predicted abandonment probability as well as determinant
               coefficients for the entire study area and summarised them for
               regions under selected EU support schemes. Our results highlight
               that agricultural abandonment was mainly explained by climate
               conditions suboptimal for agriculture (i.e., low/high growing
               degrees days). Determinants related to farm management (smaller
               field size, lower yields) and socio-economic conditions (high
               unemployment, negative migration balance) also contributed to
               describing agricultural abandonment patterns in Europe. Several
               determinants influenced abandonment in strongly non-linear ways
               and we found substantial spatial non-stationarity effects,
               although abandonment patterns were equally well-explained by
               predictors specified with spatially constant and varying effects.
               Predicted abandonment probability was similar inside and outside
               EU support or conservation zones, whereas observed MODIS-based
               abandonment was generally higher outside these zones, suggesting
               that schemes such as Natura 2000 or High Nature Value Farmland
               likely influence abandonment patterns. Our work highlights the
               potential value of spatial boosting for gaining insights into

               know much less and understand less still about the dynamic
               interplay between the discrete mechanisms. When we consider the
               likely outcome of several mechanisms operating at once, we can
               reasonably surmise that many of their effects will serve to
               amplify each other. These synergistic interactions are the
               subject of this exploratoy paper. It is proposed that synergisms
               between discrete mechanisms, working collectively and with
               compounding impact on each other, will surely lead to a greater
               scale extinction episode ultimately. In the more immediate term,
               they may cause the episode to be telescoped in its time frame
               especially in the early phases. This means that a large-scale
               elimination of species may occur even sooner than some observers
               anticipate. To the extent that this is so, there is all the

               management strategies adopted by each administrative unit. Over
               time, different management can result in discernible ecological
               differences (e.g., species composition or soil characteristics).
               Thus, fragmentation in the management landscape can correspond to
               ecological fragmentation. Different ecological patterns may
               emerge due to an increase in the number of management units in a
               region, or due to an increase in the number of different types of
               management units in the region. Temporal effects and
               collaboration history can also affect the emergence of ecotones.
               We use conceptual models to explore the relationship between

               been modified by man, and thus that the empirical and theoretical

               larger areas hold more species. The relationship between these
               two variables is such that a 100\% increase in area produces
               roughly a 25\% increase in species. Thus, two small habitat

               establishment of protected areas has long been used as a

               areas have been defined by the International Union for
               Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with different management
               objectives and protection levels. However, recent studies raised
               questions over whether protected areas are effective in
               preventing ecosystem degradation and whether IUCN categories vary
               in their effectiveness. In this study, we analysed forest loss
               and trends between 2001 and 2014 within IUCN protected areas at a
               global scale and within sixteen Intergovernmental Platform for
               Biodiversity and Ecosystem services (IPBES) subregions, relevant
               for international policy. As habitat protection can be driven by
               the location of protected areas and as the amount of forest
               within protected sites is highly unequal, we reported the forest
               loss integrating the proximity of roads and population, as well
               as the amount of initial forest in 2000. Our results show that
               worldwide, the highest protection categories experienced less
               forest loss than those allowing more human intervention, although
               this result was reversed in three IPBES subregions. Moreover, in
               four subregions there was more forest loss within protected areas
               than outside. We also found accelerating rates of forest loss in
               protected areas across all IUCN categories, more pronounced in
               the highest protection IUCN categories. Our results highlight the
               importance of moving the discussion of the post-2020 biodiversity
               framework for protected areas beyond simple general areal targets
               and that areas with poor implementation effectiveness should
               benefit from additional support.",

               Abstract. Protected areas are one of the cornerstones for
               conserving the world's re- maining biodiversity, most of which
               occurs in tropical forests. We use multiple sources of satellite
               data to estimate the extent of forest habitat and loss over the
               last 20 years within and surrounding 198 of the most highly
               protected areas (IUCN status 1 and 2) located throughout the
               world's tropical forests. In the early 1980s, surrounding habitat
               in the 50- km unprotected or less highly protected ''buffers''
               enhanced the protected areas' effective size and their capacity
               to conserve richness of forest-obligate species above the
               hypothetical case of complete isolation. However, in nearly 70\%
               of the surrounding buffers, the area of forest habitat declined
               during the last 20 years, while 25\% experienced declines within
               their administrative boundaries. The loss of habitat occurred in
               all tropical regions, but protected areas in South and Southeast
               Asia were most severely affected because of rela- tively low
               surrounding forest habitat in the early 1980s and high subsequent
               loss, particularly in dry tropical forests. The future ability of
               protected areas to maintain current species richness depends on
               integrating reserve management within the land use dynamics of
               their larger regional settings.",

               substantial portion of the world's remaining biodiversity and are

               effectiveness at the individual (224 parks) and national (23

               loss (as a proxy for deforestation) inside parks to matched
               unprotected control sites. Although significant geographical
               variation existed among parks, the majority of African parks had

               the past two years. Results indicate that if implemented as
               planned, actions proposed by the LMMCs will increase terrestrial
               and marine protected area coverage by 1,106,148 km2 and 192,214
               km2 respectively. Of these commitments, 227,230 km2 in
               terrestrial and 144,475 km2 in marine protected areas have the
               highest chance of being implemented. In total, 741 commitments
               were identified from the above sources, with implications on the
               qualitative elements of Target 11 (coverage of areas important
               for biodiversity, areas important for ecosystem services,
               ecological representation, connectivity, effective management,
               equitable management, and integration into the wider landscapes
               and seascapes). Of these 741 commitments, 25\% showed a strong
               likelihood of being implemented. The country-level analysis of
               all commitments indicates that equitable management and
               integration will show the most progress, measured against
               identified gaps, if commitments are implemented as proposed. This
               progress on the qualitative elements of Target 11 in the LMMCs
               will also provide benefits and co-benefits for other Aichi
               Targets and for the requirements of other multi-lateral
               environmental agreements, as well as at the global level.",
